# Sanrio Fan Store
Welcome to the Sanrio Fan Store project! This is a more complete version than another project called Sanrio Plushes (can be found on my GitHub) made by 2 people, Ryan Marin and myself.
I worked on the features of the application whereas my partner worked on the design.

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to understand the fundamentals of Angular. The main goal was to design and develop an online store showcasing a variety of products that we wanted. In my case I chose Sanrio plushes.
By building this project, I gained valuable skills in Angular, web development. Enjoy browsing this little website!. Feel free to check the code as well on my github.

## Development server
### Access the website
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Access the data
I use an express backend server. To start it, go to the server folder and run `npm start`. The server will run on `http://localhost:3000/`
